The app uses port 8081, and is documented with a postman collection.

I spent about 4:30 on this.

1) the CRUD Operations completed. 
2) Distance completed - Using the haversine formula
3) Related Sighting completed - Also using haversine


If I had more time I would: 

- Add a tags table to be able to do related queries
- Do Validation on POST, PUT and other data
- Add indexes for faster search time (but slower insert/update/delete)
- Close SQL connection on crash.
- Add better documentation


Thank you for this opportunity, and I look forward to going over this code with you!
